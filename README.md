# 2121: The Last Man Standing

Software's main aim is to create a platform-survival videogame.

Survival, as for an action videogame, taking place in a hostile enviroment, where the player has to survive as long as possible.

Platform, as for a 2-dimension videogame, where the player moves around on platforms, following physics rules.

In particular, the software creates a post-apocalyptic alike world, where you impersonate a human soldier left to fight against zombies hordes, equipped with firearms, having to do whatever it takes to survive, either running or fighting.

Anyway, I'd suggest fighting: that's the only way you can gain points to defeat your friends (or colleagues)!
