# 2121: The Last Man Standing

Software's main aim is to create a platform-survival videogame.

Survival, as for an action videogame, taking place in a hostile enviroment, where the player has to survive as long as possible.

Platform, as for a 2-dimension videogame, where the player moves around on platforms, following physics rules.

In particular, the software creates a post-apocalyptic alike world, where you impersonate a human soldier left to fight against zombies hordes, equipped with firearms, having to do whatever it takes to survive, either running or fighting.

Anyway, I'd suggest fighting: that's the only way you can gain points to defeat your friends (or colleagues)!

After testing our software on Windows, Mac os and Linux, we stumbled on some problems on linux, so we acted to solve them, managing to fix our code for almost each case.
Anyway there were problems of various kind and a few of them managed to survive our fixing axe. They are cause by some specific Linux versions, which might cause a little lag or bug.
The few bugs survived are caused by FXGL framework, on which we relied for our project.
Considered our limited time and experience, we did our best to offer a flowing, fun game.
Enjoy!
